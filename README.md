# Loan-Prediction

# Presentation :

This is a personnal project, the aim is to perform a binary classification on the Loan_Status feature of the Loan_prediction dataset (Can be download from this git or from Kaggle)

I've tested out 3 different algorithms so far : K_neighboor Classifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier with LogisiticRegression giving the best result.

# TODO :

- More data pre-processing (ie: Discuss missing value, for now num datas were changed by their median but i need to check if just removing the datas wouldn't provide better results)
- More and more data pre-processing (ie : discussing encoding cat datas)
- More and more and more data pre-processing (ie: Feature selection)
- Hyper parameter tuning (Implement Grid Searching)
- Add new models (RandomForest, SVM, ..)
- Create pipelines that i can reuse for latter project
- Maybe do some benchmark and add some logs
- Have fun
