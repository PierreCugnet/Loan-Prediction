# Loan-Prediction

# Presentation :

This is a personnal project, the aim is to perform a binary classification on the Loan_Status feature of the Loan_prediction dataset (Can be download from this git or from Kaggle)

I've tested out 3 different algorithms so far : K_neighboor Classifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier with LogisiticRegression giving the best result.

# TODO :

- Hyper parameter tuning (Implement Grid Searching)
- Add new models
- Create pipeline that i can reuse for latter project
